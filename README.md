# Forecasting-Economic-conditions
Forecast Economic conditions using Marcov Chain and Monte Carlo Simulation.
Here, I Developed a Monte Carlo simulation model with a Markov Chain transition matrix to analyze the probabilistic dynamics of future scenario transitions and the duration a newly entered state is expected to persist.
